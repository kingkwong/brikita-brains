Description:

We are planning to create a website with user accounts. It will have a set of 3 to 6 simple, tests that test different skills 
like reflexes, emotional intelligence, quick memorization and problem solving skills. These tests will be perceived to be games 
to make them fun, while also looking for a person's performance in a certain task. The results will be stored in a data file alongside 
the results of other users. The performance of the user will then be compared with the performance of other users and the user can be told,
which skill they lack and should practice as a result. If the user continues to practice this test, their progress will also be shown to 
them. 

We plan to create such a website by having a home page that has links to each of the tests/games and also a page for signup and login. 
The users and passwords will be stored in a csv file like in the login hw. The tests will be created with svg (scalable vector graphics) 
and will be simple. For example, a test that ask the user to quickly click on a rectangle as soon as it changes color, or to distinguish 
an image of a sad person from images of happy people ( a test for emotional intelligence). The results will than be stored in a record in 
a csv file. Python will store and retrieve the info in the csv file and analyze the data.
