		<h1> Documentation for BrikitaBrains </h1>
		
		<h1> Description </h1>
		<p> 
            BrikitaBrains is all about creating games that test various skills that the brain uses.
            For our first game, The Stroop Test, we aim to test the effect of dissociating observations
            with the semantics we give the word. Words will be displayed along with colored "barrels."
            The goal is to say the color of the barrel, regardless of what the word says. Foundations
            are in place for the addition of future games.
        </p>
		<p> 
            Our website starts off with an option to either log in or sign up to use our service.
            Account information is stored in a centralized CSV file.
            Once the user signs in, they are presented with a variety of options, such as to play
            one of our games (for demostration purposes, there is only one game implemented at this time),
            see their own personal results, or see how they stack up against other users. All the games 
            that are / will be implemented are simple, designed with SVG (scalable vector graphics).
            Future games will test various brain skills. For example, a test that ask the user to quickly click on a 
            rectangle as soon as it changes color, or to distinguish an image of a sad person from images of happy people ( a test 
            for emotional intelligence). The results will than be stored in a record in a csv file. Python will store and retrieve 
            the info in the csv file and analyze the data.

            <p> 
                Thanks to Shiva (p.10) and Kenny (p.10) for allowing us to use their stylesheets to improve
                the website's appearance. Here's a 
                <a href="http://homer.stuy.edu/~shivasuryan.vummidi/project/"> link </a>
                to their project.

        <h2> Programming / Ideas </h2>
            <p> 
                The inspiration for the Stroop Test was an actual test, named after John Ridley Stroop.
                This test demostrates the interference in the reaction time in the task. To learn more,
                here's a link to a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect"> wikipedia article </a> that goes more in-depth. 
            </p>
            
        <h2> Data Sources </h2>
            <p> All data is generated by our python game code, developed by Nikita and Brian.</p>

						Consists of three tests, each consisting of 20 random color words being shown, i.e. "RED", "BLUE",

							<li> 
								Test: Words are in various colored ink that match what the word says, submit what the word says
								Ex: The word "RED" is in red ink. The correct submittion would be "RED"
							</li>

								Test: Words are in various colored ink that don't match what the word says, submit what the 
								word says
								Ex: The word "RED" is in blue ink. The correct submittion would *still* be "RED"

            <p> Personal and global results page, which displays users' time and accuracy. </p>
            <p> Implemented account system, with encrypted passwords, stored in a CSV file. </p>
            <p> Generated and stored user results in CSV files. </p>
            
        <h2> Learning </h2>
        <p> 
            Thanks to W3Schools for providing an extensive documentation, of which we used
            to learn CSS and SVG.
        </p>
        <p>
            Used GitHub as our primary file sharing method.
        </p>
		<!-- <p></p> -->
		
		<h1> Next Steps, with time estimates </h1>
		<p> Implement new games... Estimated Time: 5-10 hours per game </p>
        <p> Add compatibility for displaying future game results.. Estimated Time: 4 hours </p>
		
		<h1> Finished Work, identified by worker </h1>
		<p> Login page... Worker(s): Nikita </p>
        <p> Sign-up page... Worker(s): Nikita </p>
        <p> Personal Results page... Worker(s): Brian </p>

		<h1> Bugs </h1>
		<p> When signing up, including commas in the entry-field will mess up record keeping for that user. </p>
        <p> Global results page (Leaderboards) will show a user's best time, regardless of their accuracy. 
        A user can exploit this by simply spamming the game, thus getting the best time. </p>
