		<h1> Documentation for BrikitaBrains </h1>
		
		<h1> Description </h1>
		<p> 
            BrikitaBrains is all about creating games that test various skills that the brain uses.
            For our first game, The Stroop Test, we aim to test the effect of dissociating observations
            with the semantics we give the word. Words will be displayed along with colored "barrels."
            The goal is to say the color of the barrel, regardless of what the word says. Foundations
            are in place for the addition of future games.
        </p>
		<p> 
            Our website starts off with an option to either log in or sign up to use our service.
            Account information is stored in a centralized CSV file.
            Once the user signs in, they are presented with a variety of options, such as to play
            one of our games (for demostration purposes, there is only one game implemented at this time),
            see their own personal results, or see how they stack up against other users. All the games 
            that are / will be implemented are simple, designed with SVG (scalable vector graphics).
            Future games will test various brain skills. For example, a test that ask the user to quickly click on a 
            rectangle as soon as it changes color, or to distinguish an image of a sad person from images of happy people ( a test 
            for emotional intelligence). The results will than be stored in a record in a csv file. Python will store and retrieve 
            the info in the csv file and analyze the data.

        <h2> People </h2>
            <p> 
                Thanks to Shiva (p.10) and Kenny (p.10) for allowing us to use their stylesheets as a foundation to add
                further graphical effects. Here's a 
                <a href="http://homer.stuy.edu/~shivasuryan.vummidi/project/"> link </a>
                to their project.
            </p>

        <h2> Programming / Ideas </h2>
            <p> 
                The inspiration for the Stroop Test was an actual test, named after John Ridley Stroop.
                This test demostrates the interference in the reaction time in the task. To learn more,
                here's a link to a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect"> wikipedia article </a> that goes more in-depth. 
            </p>
            
        <h2> Data Sources </h2>
            <p> All data is generated by our python game code, developed by Nikita and Brian.</p>

						Consists of three tests, each consisting of 20 random color words being shown, i.e. "RED", "BLUE",

							<li> 
								Test: Words are in various colored ink that match what the word says, submit what the word says
								Ex: The word "RED" is in red ink. The correct submittion would be "RED"
							</li>

								Test: Words are in various colored ink that don't match what the word says, submit what the 
								word says
								Ex: The word "RED" is in blue ink. The correct submittion would *still* be "RED"

        <h2> Learning </h2>
        <p> 
            Thanks to W3Schools for providing an extensive documentation, of which we used
            to learn CSS and SVG. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Used GitHub as our primary file sharing method.
        </p>

		<h1> Next Steps, with time estimates </h1>
		<p> Implement new games... Estimated Time: 5-10 hours per game </p>
        <p> Add compatibility for displaying future game results.. Estimated Time: 4 hours </p>
        <p> Add point system to leaderboards / global results. This will provide a general score based on a user's time and accuracy... Estimated Time: 1 hour </p>
        <p> Add sorting / filter system to user / global results... Estimated Time: 3 hours </p>
		
		<h1> Finished Work, identified by worker </h1>

        <p> Homepage... Worker(s): Nikita, Brian </p>
        <p> Stroop game... Worker(s): Nikita, Brian </p>
		
		<h1> Bugs </h1>
		<p> The security can be bypassed by typing your username in the query string </p>
        <p> Someone spams the games by rapidly clicking enter. They get a very low accuracy, but also a very fast time. This time goes down in the leader boards </p>
        <p> An animation glitch. After a word hovers through the screen it the very bottom of it can be seen in the top left corner</p>
        <p> The program once showed the same results multiple times in user results. This glitch might occur again </p>
        <p> Using commas in the username will cause the system to crash since it will confuse the csv database containing the username and their scores </p>
        <p> YOU NEED TO PLAY AT LEAST 2 GAMES FOR THE POLYLINE GRAPH IN THE RESULTS PAGE TO WORK. Here is an example of someone else's page with polyline graph's:
           <a href="http://homer.stuy.edu/~brian.kwong/project/userResults.py?user=Nikita">Nikita's user results </a></p>
        <p> If you get 0 correct on any of the three sections of the stroop test, the global leaderboards and the user results for
        that account will be broken... Thanks to Kenny Lin (p.10) for finding this!!! </p>
