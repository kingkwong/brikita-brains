		<h1> Documentation for BrikitaBrains </h1>
		
		<h1> Description </h1>
		<p> We are planning to create a website with user accounts. It will have a set of 3 to 6 simple, tests that test 
		different skills like reflexes, emotional intelligence, quick memorization and problem solving skills. These tests 
		will be perceived to be games to make them fun, while also looking for a person's performance in a certain task. The 
		results will be stored in a data file alongside the results of other users. The performance of the user will then be 
		compared with the performance of other users and the user can be told,which skill they lack and should practice as a 
		result. If the user continues to practice this test, their progress will also be shown to them. </p>
		<p> We plan to create such a website by having a home page that has links to each of the tests/games and also a page for 
		signup and login. The users and passwords will be stored in a csv file like in the login hw. The tests will be created 
		with svg (scalable vector graphics) and will be simple. For example, a test that ask the user to quickly click on a 
		rectangle as soon as it changes color, or to distinguish an image of a sad person from images of happy people ( a test 
		for emotional intelligence). The results will than be stored in a record in a csv file. Python will store and retrieve 
		the info in the csv file and analyze the data. </p>

                Thanks to Shiva (p.10) and Kenny (p.10) for allowing us to use their stylesheets to improve
                the website's appearance. Here's a 
                <a href="http://homer.stuy.edu/~shivasuryan.vummidi/project/"> link </a>
                to their project.

        <h2> Programming / Ideas </h2>
            <p> 
                The inspiration for the Stroop Test was an actual test, named after John Ridley Stroop.
                This test demostrates the interference in the reaction time in the task. To learn more,
                here's a link to a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect"> wikipedia article </a> that goes more in-depth. 
            </p>
            
        <h2> Data Sources </h2>
            <p> All data is generated by our python game code, developed by Nikita and Brian.</p>

						Consists of three tests, each consisting of 20 random color words being shown, i.e. "RED", "BLUE",
						"GREEN", etc. Goal is to submit results as fast as possible
						<ol>
							<li> Test: Words are in black ink, submit what the word says </li>
							<li> 
								Test: Words are in various colored ink that match what the word says, submit what the word says
								Ex: The word "RED" is in red ink. The correct submittion would be "RED"
							</li>
							<li> 
								Test: Words are in various colored ink that don't match what the word says, submit what the 
								word says
								Ex: The word "RED" is in blue ink. The correct submittion would *still* be "RED"
